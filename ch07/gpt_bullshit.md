# GPT's attempt at reversing linked list recursively

```
def reverseLinkedListRecursive(head):
    # Base case: if list is empty or has only one element
    if head is None or head.next is None:
        return head

    # Recursive call: reverse the rest of the list
    new_head = reverseLinkedListRecursive(head.next)

    # Reversing the pointer of the next node back to the current node
    head.next.next = head
    head.next = None  # Avoiding circular reference

    # Returning the new head of the reversed list
    return new_head
```

Let's go through a simple example, of a linked list containing the nodes "A", "B", "C" and "D".

The call stack would look like this when we reach the base case:

```
reverseLinkedListRecursive(D)
reverseLinkedListRecursive(C)
reverseLinkedListRecursive(B)
reverseLinkedListRecursive(A)
```

Because D.next is None, we enter the if condition of the base case, and we return D to the previous call on the call stack.

```
reverseLinkedListRecursive(C)
reverseLinkedListRecursive(B)
reverseLinkedListRecursive(A)
```

At this point:
- `new_head` refers to node D
- `head` refers to node C

We set: 
- `head.next.next` to `head`. Meaning that we set `D.next` to C
- `head.next` to `None`. Meaning that we set `C.next` to `None`

We return `new_head`, meaning node D to the next call on the stack

The pointers at this point are:
- A.next points to B
- B.next points to C
- C.next points to None
- D.next points to C


```
reverseLinkedListRecursive(B)
reverseLinkedListRecursive(A)
```

At this point:
- `new_head` refers to node D
- `head` refers to node B

We set:
- `head.next.next` to `head`. Meaning that we set `C.next` to B
- `head.next` to `None`. Meaning that we set `B.next` to `None`

We return `new_head`, meaning node D to the next call on the stack

The pointers at this point are:
- A.next points to B
- B.next points to None
- C.next points to B
- D.next points to C

```
reverseLinkedListRecursive(A)
```

At this points:
- `new_head` refers to node D
- `head` refers to node A

We set:
- `head.next.next` to `head`. Meaning that we set `B.next` to A
- `head.next` to `None`. Meaning that we set `A.next` to `None`

The pointers at this point are 
- A.next points to None
- B.next points to A
- C.next points to B
- D.next points to C
