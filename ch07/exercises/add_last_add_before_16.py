"""
Exercise 7.16 is to implement the 'add_last()' and 'add_before()' methods
for the PositionalList class, using a subset of its other existing methods.
This is completed in the PositionalList class itself, in the
'my_practice_implementations' module. And tested in the associated file
containing all the unit tests for PositionalList. The methods are called
'add_last_composite()' and 'add_before_composite()'.
