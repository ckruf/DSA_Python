"""
Exercise 7.17 is to implement a 'move_to_front()' method in the 
PositionalList class, which moves an item to first place by relinking
the node, rather than deleting and recreating. This is completed in the 
PositionalList class itself, in the 'my_practice_implementations' module. 
And tested in the associated file containing all the unit tests for 
PositionalList.
