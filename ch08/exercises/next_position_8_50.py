"""
Design algorithms for the following operations for a binary tree T :
• preorder next(p): Return the position visited after p in a preorder
traversal of T (or None if p is the last node visited).
• inorder next(p): Return the position visited after p in an inorder
traversal of T (or None if p is the last node visited).
• postorder next(p): Return the position visited after p in a postorder
traversal of T (or None if p is the last node visited).

These algorithms are done within the LinkedBinaryTree class in my_practice_implementations.
