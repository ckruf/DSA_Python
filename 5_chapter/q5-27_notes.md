List L of n positive integers, each represented with `k = ceil(log(n)) + 1` bits, find an `O(n)` method for finding a k-bit integer which is not in L.

For example, if n is 20, then `ceil(log(n))` is 5, therefore each integer is represented with 6 bits, giving 64 possible integers, ranging from 0 to 63, in representation from `000000` to `111111`.
